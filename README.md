# Web-based 3D Copilot

This project is a web-based 3D scene builder using Three.js and React.js, enabling users to create, manipulate, and interact with 3D objects in a browser. The application features a user-friendly UI for spawning 3D models, selecting them via raycasting, and manipulating them (move, rotate, delete) through a control panel. It supports both basic geometric shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres) and complex GLTF models (e.g., a seashell model from Sketchfab). This prototype serves as a foundation for future exploration of AI-assisted 3D world-building.
The project fulfills the requirements of the task description, including scene setup, object creation, manipulation, and integration of custom 3D models.
